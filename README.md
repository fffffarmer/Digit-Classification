# Digit-Classification
Project of CS385 (Machine Learning), SJTU

## Objective

We are supposed to:

- Have deep understanding of basic machine-learning techniques.
- Learn how to design an experiment to prove or verify your ideas.
  - I.e. learn how to ensure the scientific rigor and how to obtain convincing results, when designing experiments.
- Propose new hypotheses or our own understanding of some machine learning methods, and try to verify our opinions through experiments.
  - "Whether the hypotheses themselves are correct or not" is not the most important. Instead, focus on how we prove them correct or incorrect.
